        <h1>Course Learning Reflections</h1>
        <p><b>By Raghavendra Rao Kulkarni</b></p>

        <h2>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Iteration:</b> In nature, many processes represent iteration, such as the repetition of seasons, life cycles, or growth patterns. Iteration involves repeating a process in a loop until a condition is met, like traversing a list or simulating a cycle in time.</li>
            <li><b>Recursion:</b> Nature often demonstrates self-similarity, like fractals or decision trees. Recursion helps solve these problems by breaking them into smaller parts resembling the whole. Examples include calculating factorials or solving the N-Queens problem.</li>
            <li><b>Backtracking:</b> Decision-making processes in nature, like ant colony paths or predator-prey interactions, mirror backtracking. This approach explores all possibilities, retreating when a solution path is invalid, and advancing only when a valid path is found.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h2>
        <p>As a computer science enthusiast, I find space and time efficiency fascinating because they directly impact how effectively algorithms solve real-world problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Space Efficiency:</b> Minimizing memory usage is critical, especially for resource-limited systems. Efficient algorithms make better use of available memory.</li>
            <li><b>Time Efficiency:</b> Algorithms must execute quickly to meet the demands of real-time applications like navigation or financial systems.</li>
            <li><b>Orders of Growth:</b> Understanding growth rates is essential for analyzing algorithm performance:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>O(1):</b> Constant time, e.g., accessing an array element.</li>
                <li><b>O(log n):</b> Logarithmic time, e.g., binary search.</li>
                <li><b>O(n):</b> Linear time, e.g., iterating over a list.</li>
                <li><b>O(n log n):</b> Linearithmic time, e.g., merge sort.</li>
                <li><b>O(n²):</b> Quadratic time, e.g., nested loops.</li>
                <li><b>O(2ⁿ):</b> Exponential time, e.g., recursive algorithms.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
