        <h2>FLoyd Warshal's Algorithm in Emergency Routing</h2>
        <p>The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is useful for precomputing the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a road network, enabling quick decision-making for emergency vehicle routing in static or less dynamically changing traffic conditions.</p>

        <h3>Applications of Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in Emergency Vehicle Routing</h3>

            <div class="section-title">1. Precomputing Optimal Paths for Emergency Vehicles</div>
       <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensure quick and efficient routing of emergency vehicles by precomputing all-pairs shortest paths.</p>
       <p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
       <ul>
          <li>Floyd-Warshall algorithm computes the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the road network. These precomputed paths allow emergency services to quickly select the optimal route when an emergency arises.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> If an ambulance needs to travel between two distant locations, the algorithm ensures the precomputed shortest path is readily available, reducing response time.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Minimizes response times, reduces route calculation overhead, and ensures preparedness for various emergencies.</p>

                        <li>Initialize distances to all other nodes from the source as infinity.</li>
                        <li>Mark the source node as visited.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Find Minimum Distance:

                        <li>Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the source.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Update Distances: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>For each unvisited neighbor of the selected node:</li>
                        <li>Calculate the tentative distance through the selected node.</li>
                        <li>If the tentative distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance and parent node.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Repeat: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are visited.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
