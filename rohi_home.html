            <h2>Smart Parking System</h2>
            <p>Smart parking systems use IoT and real-time data to guide drivers to available parking spots efficiently, reducing traffic caused by searching for parking and improving the utilization of available spaces.</p>
            <p>Urban areas often suffer from parking shortages, leading to frustration, congestion, and wasted time. By installing sensors in parking spaces, cities can track availability and provide real-time data to drivers via mobile applications or digital signage. This not only makes parking more convenient for users but also reduces the environmental impact of circling for spaces and optimizes land usage within crowded cities.</p>
            <div class="section-title">Key Features</div>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Real-Time Monitoring:</span> Sensors detect whether parking spots are available or occupied, updating the system instantly to guide drivers to the nearest available space.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Mobile Integration:</span> Apps guide users to the nearest available parking spots and allow them to reserve spaces in advance, streamlining the parking process.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Reduced Congestion:</span> Minimizing the time spent searching for parking decreases overall traffic congestion and lowers emissions in urban centers.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Dynamic Pricing:</span> Smart parking systems can implement dynamic pricing, adjusting rates based on demand, location, and time of day to ensure optimal space usage.</li>
